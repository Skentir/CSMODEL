    "The dataset used in this case study is based on the medical records of heart failure patients collected at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan) from April 2015 to December 2015 [1, 2]. The researchers of the original study ensured that all patients who participated in the data collection are aware of the situation and have provided their consent [2]. Additionally, the original study was approved by Institutional Review Board of Government College University, Faisalabad-Pakistan and followed the principles of Helsinki Declaration [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consisted of 299 observations, wherein one observation is a medical report of a heart failure patient. In total, there are 105 female patients and 194 male patients whose medical report was included in the dataset. All of the patients are above 40 years old and have left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), a complication caused when the left ventricle of the heart loses its ability to contract. The left ventricle of the heart is responsible for pumping oxygen-rich blood into circulation and LVSD results to the heart having weaker pumping force. This puts all the patients for this dataset under Class III or IV of New York Heart Association's (NYHA) Functional Classification – a classification for how limited a patient is during physical activity. Patients under Class III and IV are vulnerable to fatigue easily and experiences discomfort when any physical activity is performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on Ahmad et. al's case study, the following features were considered as potential variables to explain mortality caused by cardiovascular diseases like heart failure: age, gender, blood pressure (BP), ejection fraction (EF), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), platelet count, serum sodium, serum creatinine, and whether the patient has anemia, diabetes, and is a smoker [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some information like anemia, high blood pressure, diabetes, sex, and smoking where represented as binary data – with 1 as an indicator that the feature is true for that particular patient and 0 amounting to false. For example, a patient who has 1 on anemia but 0 for high blood pressure means that the patient has anemia but no symptoms for high blood pressure. Anemia classifications were determined by the hospital physician using the patient's haematocrit level. If a patient has haematocrit levels less than 36%, the minimum for a normal haematocrit level, then they were considered as anemic. For the classification of high blood pressure and smoking status, the original researchers used physician reports. \n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical risk factors were generated from the patients' blood reports and medical records. EF pertains to the amount of blood pumped out by the left ventricle for each contraction and is represented in percentage format. CPK describes the level of CPK enzymes in the blood and is represented in micrograms per liter (mcg/L). CPK was used as a risk factor for high levels of CPK in the blood could indicate heart failure or injury because more CPK is flowing in the blood during muscle tissue damage. A risk factor related with CPK is serum creatinine. Serum creatinine is a waste product generated by creatinine that comes from the normal wear and tear on muscles of the body. Like CPK, high levels of serum creatinine could indicate heart failure. In the dataset, serum creatinine is represented in values of milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Serum sodium is the indicator used to measure the sodium level in a patient's blood. It is represented as milliequivalents per litre (mEq/L). Sodium is important for ensuring that muscles and nerves are functioning correctly. Therefore, abnormally low levels of sodium in the blood might be caused by a heart failure. Platelet count was recorded as kiloplatelets per millilitre (kiloplatelets/mL).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other features of the dataset includes a follow-up period measured in days and a variable for whether a patient is still alive or not called \"death event\". Like the rest of binary data in the study, 1 indicates that a patient is already dead, while 0 is the indicator for patients that are still alive. Follow-up period refers to the act of monitoring a patient's health after treatment, including when a patient participates in a clinical study or trial for a period of time. In the study, follow-up time varies per patient and is the basis for the death event feature, meaning patients that died within the follow-up period will have their death event recorded as 1."

    "Regardless of the field of study, accurate data collection is important to maintain the integrity of the research. Appropriate selection of data collection instruments and clearly outlined instructions for the actual data gathering procedure reduces the likelihood of errors occuring. Thus, the dataset used in the original case study and this case study should not be an exception. Failure to comply to these methods could possibly result to having difficulties in answering the proposed research questions. Furthermore, even if the data analysis was executed, there is no guarantee that acquired results are accurate and clearly reflects the initial intention of the whole data gathering process. "
