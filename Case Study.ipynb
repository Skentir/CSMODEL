The researchers of the original study ensured that all patients who participated in the data collection are aware of the situation and have provided their consent [2]. Additionally, the original study was approved by Institutional Review Board of Government College University, Faisalabad-Pakistan and follows the principles of Helsinki Declaration [2]."
